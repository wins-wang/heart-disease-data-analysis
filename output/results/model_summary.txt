Heart Disease Mortality Prediction Project - Model Summary
===========================================================

Dataset:
---------
- 1,069 U.S. counties
- 23 features (health behavior, economic indicators, demographics, regional classifications)
- Data sources: USDA, CDC, Census Population Estimates, Bureau of Labor Statistics

Data Preprocessing:
--------------------
- Merged datasets, handled missing values (~66% rows removed)
- Feature transformations: log(x+1) and square root transformations applied

Modeling:
---------
1. LASSO Regression
    - Cross-validated RMSE (test set): 25.2
    - Selected key predictors: obesity, smoking, diabetes, low birthweight, physical inactivity

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Retained 4 principal components
    - Captured ~70.7% of total variance

3. Factor Analysis
    - Extracted latent factors related to health conditions and economic stress
    - Variables with >90% correlation removed prior to analysis

4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - Area_Rucc classification accuracy: 73.2%
    - Economic Typology classification accuracy: 63.7%
    - Urban Influence classification accuracy: 60.2%
    - Confusion matrix created for Area_Rucc

Key Insights:
--------------
- Health behaviors (obesity, smoking, diabetes) strongly predict heart disease mortality
- Urban-rural distinctions and economic typologies impact regional health outcomes
- Predictive modeling can support public health resource targeting and policy decisions
