# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the heart disease mortality prediction project.

## Structure
- `raw/` — Original unprocessed data (e.g., heart_disease.csv)
- `processed/` — Cleaned data ready for analysis (e.g., clean_hd.csv)

## Notes
- Raw data were sourced from public datasets (USDA, CDC, Census, BLS).
- Processed data removed missing values and normalized selected features.
- If sensitive, raw data access may be restricted via `.gitignore`.
